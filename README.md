## About

Green Flag AI is a world-class AI assurance and readiness platform designed to provide organizations with the structural confidence needed to deploy generative systems at scale. By unifying fragmented data from security scanners, model registries, and compliance frameworks, the platform acts as a high-fidelity "command center" for AI governance. It translates complex, low-level technical signals—such as hallucination rates, latent risk vectors, and regulatory drifts—into clear, executive-level "go-live" decisions. With a focus on developer-first transparency and rigorous alignment with frameworks like the EU AI Act and NIST, Green Flag AI ensures that every model is not just performant, but safe, compliant, and ready for production.
